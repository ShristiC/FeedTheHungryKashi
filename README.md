An app designed to help field workers help the poor and provide resouces to the people of Kashi (a village in India). 

## Details
The App will take basic information such as a person's first and last name, their adhar pan card number, city, and phone number to begin with.

The field workers who have access to the app will be verified and logged in using google authentication. 

The information inputted by the app needs to be stored in a database and be retrievable.
